## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before you start using the Serverless Image Handler, make sure you meet the following prerequisites:

1. **AWS Account:**
   - You need an active AWS account to deploy and utilize the Serverless Image Handler.

2. **AWS CLI:**
   - Install and set up the [AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI)](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) to interact with AWS services locally.

3. **AWS Credentials:**
   - Ensure that you have your AWS credentials properly configured on your local machine. You can configure these credentials using the AWS CLI or other suitable methods.

4. **AWS Services:**
   - The Serverless Image Handler relies on the following AWS services:
     - **AWS CloudFormation:**
       - This service is used for infrastructure as code, allowing you to define and provision AWS infrastructure securely and predictably.

     - **Amazon CloudFront:**
       - It is a content delivery network (CDN) service that securely and efficiently delivers images to users.

     - **Amazon API Gateway:**
       - Used to create, publish, and manage APIs, providing a secure and scalable API endpoint for your Serverless Image Handler.

     - **AWS Lambda:**
       - Enables you to run code without the need to provision or manage servers, making it an excellent choice for serverless image processing functions.

     - **Amazon S3:**
       - A highly scalable object storage service used to store and retrieve images efficiently.

     - **Amazon Rekognition (optional):**
       - If you plan to use image recognition features, make sure that the [Amazon Rekognition](https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/) service is properly configured and accessible.

     - **AWS Secrets Manager (optional):**
       - This service is used for securely storing and managing sensitive information, such as API keys or credentials.

Ensure that these services are configured and that you have the necessary permissions to deploy and manage resources within your AWS account.

### Installation

To set up the Serverless Image Handler, follow these steps:

1. **Upload the CloudFormation Template to Amazon S3:**
   - If your CloudFormation template is stored locally, manually upload it to an Amazon S3 bucket. Make sure the template is accessible for deployment.

2. **Initiate the Deployment of the Serverless Image Handler AWS CloudFormation template:**
   - Navigate to the [AWS CloudFormation Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/).
   - Click the "Create stack" button.
   - Choose "Upload a template file" and use the "Choose file" option to select your CloudFormation template from your local machine.
   - Click "Next" to proceed with the deployment.

   *Note: By default, the template deploys in the US East (N. Virginia) Region. If you want to deploy it in a different AWS Region, utilize the Region selector in the console navigation bar.*

3. On the "Specify stack details" page, assign a name to your solution stack.

4. Under "Parameters," review and adjust the solution parameters as needed.

5. Click "Next."

6. On the "Configure stack options" page, click "Next."

7. On the "Review" page, carefully review and confirm the settings. Don't forget to select the box acknowledging that the template creates IAM resources.

8. Click "Create stack" to initiate the stack deployment.

9. Keep an eye on the stack status in the AWS CloudFormation console. You should expect a "CREATE_COMPLETE" status in approximately 15 minutes.

## Architecture

The Serverless Image Handler employs a scalable and serverless architecture, seamlessly integrating multiple essential AWS services to effectively process and deliver images.

### Explanation of the Workflow

1. **Client Request:**
   - When a client requests image processing, they send a request to the Amazon CloudFront distribution associated with the Serverless Image Handler.

2. **CloudFront Distribution:**
   - CloudFront serves as the content delivery network (CDN) and forwards the client's request to the Amazon API Gateway.

3. **Amazon API Gateway:**
   - API Gateway manages the API and triggers an AWS Lambda function to handle the requested image processing tasks.

4. **AWS Lambda:**
   - The Lambda function retrieves the original image from Amazon S3, applies the specified image processing features, and returns the processed image. Optionally, it may make calls to Amazon Rekognition for tasks like facial recognition or content moderation.

5. **Amazon S3 (Storage):**
   - Both the original and processed images are stored in Amazon S3, ensuring durability and scalability.

6. **Amazon Rekognition (Optional):**
   - If necessary, the Lambda function can interact with Amazon Rekognition for advanced image analysis.

7. **Secrets Manager (Optional):**
   - When signature validation is enabled, the Lambda function retrieves secret values from AWS Secrets Manager for added security.

8. **Response to Client:**
   - The Lambda function generates a response that includes the processed image or relevant information, which is sent back through API Gateway and CloudFront to the client.

This coordinated workflow guarantees efficient serverless image processing with a focus on scalability, security, and optimal performance.
## Usage

### Deploying the Serverless Image Handler

1. **Upload CloudFormation Template:**
   - Upload the CloudFormation template (`serverless-image-handler-template.yaml`) to an Amazon S3 bucket of your choice.

2. **Launch the CloudFormation Stack:**
   - Open the [AWS CloudFormation Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/).
   - Click "Create stack" and choose "With new resources."
   - In the "Specify template" section, choose "Amazon S3 URL" and enter the URL of your uploaded CloudFormation template.
   - Follow the on-screen instructions to configure the stack parameters and complete the deployment.

### Configuring Lambda Function Features

1. **Feature Configuration:**
   - In the deployed Lambda function (`ImageHandlerFunction`), features such as smart cropping and content moderation are available.
